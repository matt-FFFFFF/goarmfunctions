# goarmfunctions

This go module provides an implementation of some ARM template functions in Go.
It is a work in progress and not all functions are implemented yet, and may never will be.

Also some functions are implemented in a way that they are not 100% compatible with the ARM template functions.
For example, the `format` function does not support format specifiers.
